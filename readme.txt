A backtracking algorithm is a type of algorithm that is used to solve problems that involve finding all possible solutions or configurations. It is particularly useful when there are constraints that limit the possible solutions. Backtracking algorithms work by incrementally building a candidate solution to the problem, and then checking whether it satisfies the constraints. If the solution satisfies the constraints, it is accepted. If not, the algorithm backtracks to the last decision point and tries a different path.

In the context of solving Sudoku puzzles, the backtracking algorithm works by incrementally filling in the empty cells on the board with numbers, one by one. At each step, the algorithm checks whether the number being added is valid according to the rules of Sudoku (i.e. it does not violate any of the constraints). If the number is valid, the algorithm moves on to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If the number is not valid, the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision point and tries a different number. The algorithm continues in this way until either a complete solution is found or all possible configurations have been explored without finding a solution.


FUNCTIONS EXPLAINED

print_board(board): This function takes a 2D list board as input and prints it out in a tabular format, with each row separated by a horizontal line and each cell separated by vertical bars.

find_empty(board): This function takes a 2D list board as input and returns the row and column indices of the next empty cell (i.e. a cell with a value of 0) in the board. If there are no more empty cells, the function returns None.

valid(board, num, pos): This function takes a 2D list board, an integer num, and a tuple pos representing the row and column indices of a cell in the board, and checks whether num can be placed in the cell without violating the rules of Sudoku. The function returns True if the placement is valid, and False otherwise.

solve(board): This is the main function that solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The function takes a 2D list board as input and modifies it in place to contain the solved puzzle. The function first calls find_empty to find the next empty cell, and if there are no more empty cells, the function returns True to indicate that the puzzle has been solved. If there are still empty cells, the function tries each possible number from 1 to 9 in the cell using a loop. For each number that is valid according to the rules of Sudoku, the function recursively calls itself with the updated board. If the recursive call returns True, then the puzzle has been solved and the function returns True. If the recursive call returns False, the function backtracks by setting the cell to 0 and trying the next number. If none of the numbers from 1 to 9 are valid, the function returns False to indicate that the puzzle is unsolvable.

In summary, the solve function uses the find_empty and valid functions to find the next empty cell and check whether a number can be placed in a given cell without violating the rules of Sudoku. The function recursively calls itself to try different numbers in each empty cell until the puzzle is solved or all possibilities have been exhausted. The print_board function is used to display the solved puzzle in a tabular format.
